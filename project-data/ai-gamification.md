A research project about using machine learning to personalize gamification in educational applications to teach programming, specifically Python. Part of my work as research assistant under Professor Christian Lopez. Did web-scraping for app reviews using python, analysis on various data with your usual numpy/pandas, as well natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as sentiment analysis to identify gamification features and their effects. Also did web development on the website above and development on the actual educational application being tested itself using PyQt. Collaborated with a lot of other researchers on the project, but tasks were mostly delegated from my supervisor.
