A little piece I wrote for my first college writing class that I'm actually decently proud of. This was during the pandemic, I basically tried to inhabit an old conservative pundit trying to convince his viewers to get vaccinated. I'm not intimately familiar with a lot of old conservative pundits, but this was super fun to execute.
