A native desktop social media application for fish enthusiasts in C++ using Qt, using SQlite for data storage. 
Users could communicate, form subcommunities, create profiles for themselves and their fish. Semester long group project, I worked with 2 other people. My first time really collaborating with other developers and dealing with hard product deadlines, so very educational. Learned a lot about how to justify and explain architectural decisions to team members, how to balance short and long term considerations, as well was more technical stuff like github collaboration workflows. Worked full-stack, but mostly backend and database.
