A class scheduler for my high school's administration. The school stopped using it when the IT guy that maintained it left a year after I graduated, so I don't actually have the code base anymore. Basically it would take in hard requirements like class requirements and teacher availability as well as some soft requirements like teacher preferences, and generate the schedules for all 4 classes, as this was previously done manually by school administrators. This was my first ever real code project, done entirely in Java (my first ever coding language) with the UI created using Swing. The surprising amount of enjoyment and motivation I got from this project was actually what made go into CS for college in the first place.
